# 👨‍💻 Massimo Modesti
**Automation Engineer | Embedded Systems Nerd | Code & Circuit Lover**

Hey! I’m Max — a proud nerd who genuinely *loves* automation, robotics, and all the magic that happens when code meets electronics.

I get excited about things like microcontroller interrupts, PID tuning, and wiring up sensors at 2AM. I speak Python and C, and I feel at home with **STM32s**, **PLCs**, and anything that beeps, clicks, or blinks.

## 🧠 Things I *nerd out* about:
- Embedded systems & low-level coding  
- Industrial automation & control logic  
- Robots that move with purpose  
- Clean, efficient code that talks to hardware  
- Teaching and making technical stuff feel simple  

## 🔌 What I do:
I spend my time building, experimenting, breaking stuff (on purpose), and figuring out how to make it better.  
I also help students who feel lost in math or physics rediscover their confidence — because I believe tech should empower, not scare.
